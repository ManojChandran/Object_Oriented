# Efficient "CLASS"

Once the CLASS and OBJECT is defined, we extend our work to improve it. Industry came up with guidelines to create an efficient class, which is key for any solution.

First step towards Object Orientation, is to design an efficient class. The theory of SOLID principles was introduced by Martin in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns.

An efficient Class is created, when class construction follow SOLID principle.

```
  SOLID stands for
   S - Single responsibility Principle
   O - Open Closed Principle
   L - Liskov Substitution Principle
   I - Interface Segregation Principle
   D - Dependency Inversion Principle
```

### Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have one and only one reason to changes.
### Open Closed Principle
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
### Liskov Substitution Principle
Sub types must be substitutable for their base type.
### Interface Segregation Principle
The dependency of one class to another, should depend on the smallest possible interface.
### Dependency Inversion Principle
Depends on abstractions (interfaces), not on concrete classes.
