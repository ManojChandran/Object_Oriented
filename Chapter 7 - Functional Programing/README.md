# Introduction

We seems to have travelled a long way in questioning and understanding the Programming concepts. But, to date programmers are not happy. 

## Why is that programmer still not happy?

Single bug will take all his / her sleep away, hours sitting in programming chair and stairing at the code has become routine. Sometimes we are checking on others code, other times its our own blood. We have decades of experience, knowledge and research in coding, still we are not fully out of this situation.
