# Everything has a origin

Human civilization evolved every day and with each step in evolution, a complex question blocked him in every step. He found a companion to help, machine. Day by day our need to solve problem and its complexity increased, simultaneously need for more powerful machine also.

Problems around, where from real world!!!
they need real world thoughts and solutions. Real world is full of objects and their solutions is also related with it. First approach the problem is to find a method to address things as objects as in real world.

# What is an Object and Class?

An Object in real world will have attributes (color, texture,..) and behavior(scroll, bend..). When you define the same in computer world, A "CLASS" is born.

Object (attribute & behavior)
--> Define object's attribute and behavior
--> Get Class.

Class is a blue print of the object, its efficiency and design improves your solution. Success of your solution depends on how you define and design your classes.

# How to create an Efficient "CLASS"?

An efficient Class is created when class construction follow SOLID principle. Set of rules to define an efficient class.

1) Single responsibility principle
2) Open Closed principle
3) Liskov Substitution Principle
4) Interface segregation principle
5) Dependency Inversion principle

# What happens when an efficient class is created?

An efficient Class construction will give you the object, which have real worl obejct properties. Object orientation gives features like

1) Abstraction
2) Inheritance
3) Polymorphism
4) Encapsulation

# What happens when Object acquires real world properties?

The Objects inside solution will acquire

1) Association
2) Aggregation
3) Composition
4) Dependency

# What was the new challenge?

With acquired power and features, we started solving bigger issues. At a point there was a realization that, coding has become increasingly complex. So complex, that maintenance became very hard. There were certain times when we need to rewrite the entire code, re architect it.

# How can we solve it?

On gradual study we arrived at OOP principles which will help you to simply things. Basic OOP principles are explained below.

1) Encapsulate what varies.
2) Favor Composition over Inheritance.
3) Program to Interface, not to implementation.

# How to implement OOP principle?

Design Patterns : general Repeatable/ Proven solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Design Pattern is classified into

1) Creational
2) Structural
3) Behavioral

Once you get hold on these Design Patterns, you are ready to solve mysteries and go beyond. Ultimately, solution is also an Object which has a meaning now .....
