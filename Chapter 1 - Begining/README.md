# Introduction

This chapter gives an introduction on evolution of object oriented programming and computer programming in general. Below narration is outline the upcoming chapters in a slice.

# Everything has a beginning

Human civilization evolved every day and with each step in evolution, complex questions blocked him in every step. He needed a companion and found one to help, machine.

Day by day our need to solve problem and its complexity increased, simultaneously need for more powerful machine also.

Problems around, where from real world!!!
they need real world thoughts and solutions. Real world is full of objects and their solutions is also related with it. First approach to the problem was to identify a method to address objects, similarly as objects in real world.

# Object and Class

An Object in real world will have attributes (color, texture,..) and behavior(scroll, bend..). When you define the same in computer world, A "CLASS" is born.

Object (attribute & behavior)
--> Define object's attribute and behavior, we will get a Class.

Class is a blue print of the object, its efficiency and design improves your solution. All success of your solution, depends on
   1) How you define object with a class?
   2) How you define interaction between objects, using classes?

# Efficient "CLASS"

First step towards Object Orientation, is to learn to design an efficient class.

An efficient Class is created, when class construction follow SOLID principle. SOLID acronym stands for

 S - Single responsibility principle</br>
 O - Open Closed principle</br>
 L - Liskov Substitution Principle</br>
 I - Interface segregation principle</br>
 D - Dependency Inversion principle</br>

# What happens when an efficient class is created?

An efficient Class construction will give you the object, which have all real world object properties. This Object orientation gives the object, features like

1) Abstraction
2) Inheritance
3) Polymorphism
4) Encapsulation

# What happens when Object acquires real world properties?

This Enhances the created object in their interaction and operations. The Objects inside solution will acquire capabilities mentioned below

1) Association
2) Aggregation
3) Composition
4) Dependency

# What was the new challenge?

With acquired power and features, we started solving bigger issues. At a point there was a realization that, coding has become increasingly complex. So complex, that maintenance became very hard. There were certain times when we need to rewrite the entire code, re architect it.

# How can we solve it?

On gradual study we arrived at OOP principles which will help you to simplify things. Basic OOP principles are explained below.

1) Encapsulate what varies.
2) Favor Composition over Inheritance.
3) Program to Interface, not to implementation.

# How to implement OOP principle?

Design Patterns : general Repeatable/ Proven solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Design Pattern is classified into

1) Creational
2) Structural
3) Behavioral

Once you get hold on these Design Patterns, you are ready to solve mysteries and go beyond. Ultimately, solution is also an Object which has a meaning now .....
