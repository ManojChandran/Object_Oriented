# Introduction

Evolving complex systems and new challenges, are making life hell for coders. The thrive for efficient and optimized code is need of the times. To tackle this, strong basics and understanding core principle in writing code is needed. We need to understand the evolution of computer programming in general and rise of object oriented programming.

# Everything has a beginning

Human civilization evolved every day and with each step in evolution, complex questions blocked him in his journey. We needed a companion and found one to help us in desperate times, Machine !!!!!

World of machine fascinated us and we devoted ourselves to the mechanics of their working. Day by day our need to solve problem and its complexity increased, simultaneously need for more powerful and intelligent machine increased. They started obeying us with language we decided to communicate with them, thus Software came into existence.

We started solving real world problems and at times break our backs to make the machine understand it.

Problems around, where from real world!!!
They need real world thoughts and solutions. Real world is full of objects and their solutions is also related with it. First approach to solve the problem was to identify a method to address entities associated with in real world and realize the same in program world. The idea to create "OBJECT" was born...

# Object and Class

An Object in real world will have attributes (color, texture,..) and behavior(scroll, bend..). When you define the same in computer world, A "CLASS" is born.

Object (attribute & behavior)
--> Define object's attribute and behavior, we will get a Class.

Class is a blue print of the object, its efficiency and design improves your solution. All success of your solution, depends on

   1) How you define OBJECT using a CLASS? </br>
   2) How you define interaction between OBJECTS, using CLASS? </br>

# Efficient "CLASS"

First step towards Object Orientation, is to learn to design an efficient class.

An efficient Class is created, when we follow SOLID principle in CLASS construction.

  SOLID </br>

   S - Single responsibility principle</br>
   O - Open Closed principle</br>
   L - Liskov Substitution Principle</br>
   I - Interface segregation principle</br>
   D - Dependency Inversion principle</br>

# What happens when an efficient class is created?

Following the guidelines of SOLID principle, an efficient Class will be constructed. Efficiently constructed class, which have all real world object properties. Objects created out of these classes will give features like

1) Abstraction
2) Inheritance
3) Polymorphism
4) Encapsulation

# What happens when Object acquires real world properties?

This Enhances the created object in their interaction and operations. The Objects inside solution will acquire capabilities of

1) Association
2) Aggregation
3) Composition
4) Dependency

# New challenge

With acquired power and features, we started solving bigger issues. At a point there was a realization that, coding has become increasingly complex. So complex, that maintenance became very hard. There were certain times when we need to rewrite the entire code, re architect it.

# How can we solve it?

On gradual study we arrived at OOP principles which will help you to simplify things. Basic OOP principles are explained below.

1) Encapsulate what varies.
2) Favor Composition over Inheritance.
3) Program to Interface, not to implementation.

# How to implement OOP principle?

Simple answer to this was to understand design patter and use it according to the situation.
Design Patterns : general Repeatable/ Proven solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Design Pattern is classified into

1) Creational - deals with creation of the object
2) Structural - deals with composition of the object
3) Behavioral - deals with communication between the object

Once you get hold on these Design Patterns, you are ready to solve mysteries and go beyond. Ultimately, solution is also an Object which has a meaning now .....
