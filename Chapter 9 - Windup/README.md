## Where are we going?

Idea of learning to code, in a particular language is not about learning syntax or grammar. There are much more aesthetic involved in the process. Everybody who heard about any programming language know, how an IF statement works. Knowing to write a IF condition and FOR loop will land us in literacy count, solving a problem is far.

Certain languages are opinionated and certain are not, crucial thing is to know the opinion. We should have questions and definite answers about the language, questions which are fundamental. Basic questions needed to be asked...

1) Who is using this language?
2) Why are they promoting it?
3) What is that, we solving by using this particular language?
4) How it runs in a machine?
5) How it compiles? How is it packaged?
6) Is the language typed?
7) Is the language opinionated?
9) Does it support functional programming?


Understanding data structure and algorithm is one thing, implementing it elegantly is the key. Software solutions demand more Openness, Clarity and Structure, it directly depends on the person writing the solution. Clear understanding of the
