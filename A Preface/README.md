# Preface

The book is road map for you to become a developer. Everybody starts their journey by selecting a programming language and mastering its techniques. But programming is beyond that, knowing the language technique help you in reading the code. You understand the what program is doing and what coder is trying to achieve, actual solution design is more than that. We need to understand the aesthetic of code and nature of its design.

More than ever, the need for good programming engineer is increasing day by day. The complex systems set around us are very mush influential and guiding our life in a different way. More and more application are getting designed, its changing the way we see the world and interact with it.

I am trying to push everybody to ask question on why are we coding like this, or why programming language have an opinion?
