# Preface

This Book is attempt to find a new to approach for learning a programming language. We are trying to address the fundamentals and basics of coding, create a road map to become a developer and start journey towards a better developer. Primary step in this journey is to start by selecting a programming language and mastering its techniques. But programming is beyond the techniques we learn, knowing the language and technique help us in better reading of code. We can understand the what program is talking about and what coder is trying to create, actual solution designing is more than that. We need to understand the aesthetic of code, nature of its design artistic about using the techniques.

More than ever, the need for good programmer is increasing day by day. The complex systems set around us are very mush influential and guiding our life in a different ways. More and more application are getting designed, its changing the way we see the world and interact with it.

Success mantra of modern era programming is "Write code that can adapt to changes".

This is an introductory textbook and assume basic Java programming knowledge, most of the coding examples are in JAVA. This is an attempt to push everybody to rethink the way we code and start asking simple question.
 
* why are we coding like this?</br>
* why programming languages are written like this?</br>
* Do we have a better, maintainable and peaceful approach?</br>
