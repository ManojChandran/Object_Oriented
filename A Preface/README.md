# Preface

Decade old idea of learning language by learing synatx is not working, we are not becoming the developer in need. World need developers who can address modern problems, tackle complex solution, write maintainable and evolving code. With this book we are trying to ask the basic and fundemental questions, will also try to address them. We are trying to create a road map to become a developer and start journey towards a better developer. 

Primary step followed by all, is to select a programming language and start mastering its techniques. But programming is beyond the techniques we learn and knowing the language, technique only help us in better reading of code. We can understand...</br>
 what program is talking about? </br>
 what coder is trying to create? </br>
Actual solution designing is more than that. Code should shout the context, open its door to expand and always be simple. 

More than ever, the need for good programmer is increasing day by day. The complex systems set around us are very much influential and guiding our life in different ways. More and more application are getting designed, its changing the way we see the world and interact with it.

Success mantra of modern era programming is "Write code that can adapt to changes".

A word of warning and encouragement: This is not an introductory textbook to any language, we are not here to teach programming language. This book assume you have a basic knowledge of computer and Java programming, most of the coding examples are in JAVA. This is an attempt to push everybody to rethink the way we code and start asking simple question.
 
* Why are we coding like this?</br>
* Why programming languages are written like this?</br>
* Do we have a better, maintainable and peaceful approach?</br>

# What's in this book?
This book is designed with the chapters acting, to a reasonable extent, as standalone guides. If you are new to programming language, please brush up you basics in JAVA.

Here is how the book is Organized:

Chapter 1 - Beginning                                                 </br>

   How to create an Object?                                           </br>
   Who creates Object for us?                                         </br>
   How to set state of an Object?                                     </br>
   How to refer the Object varibles?                                  </br>

Chapter 3 - Class deep dive                                           </br>
   How are the Data security aspects of Class handled?                </br>
   What are the types of class available?                             </br>
   How can we build an efficient class?                               </br>

Chapter 4 - Class Properties and Capabilities                         </br>
   What happens when an efficient class is build?    
   What are 4 major principles, which makes solution an Object oriented?   </br>
   What is that our solution gaining by applying 4 principle?         </br>
   What happens when our solution applies Object oriented principles? </br>
   How to gauge the quality of Class?                                 </br>

Chapter 5 - New Challenge                                             </br>
   What was the new challenge?                                        </br>
   What are the basic principle to write a maintainable code?         </br>

Chapter 6 - Design Patterns                                           </br>
   How to implement Object Oriented design principles?                </br>
