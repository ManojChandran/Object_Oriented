# New Challenge

Road to Object Oriented Programming was open and we started getting traffic jam. Consistently the promise of  reuse and maintainable code was broken.

## What was the new challenge?

With acquired power and features, we started solving bigger issues. At a point there was a realization that, coding has become increasingly complex. So complex, that maintenance became very hard. There were certain times when we need to rewrite the entire code, re architect it.

## What are basic principle to write a maintainable code?

On gradual study we arrived at OOP principles which will help you to simplify things. Basic OOP principles are explained below.

1) Encapsulate what varies.
2) Favor Composition over Inheritance.
3) Program to Interface, not to implementation.

## How to gauge the quality of Class?
Grady Booch proposes five metrics to measure the quality of classes:

      Coupling
      Cohesion
      Sufficiency
      Completeness
      Primitiveness
