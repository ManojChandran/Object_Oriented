# New Challenge
## What was the new challenge?

Road became congested with implementation of these ideas, We started getting traffic jam. Half of the us started believing, knowing an object oriented principle and applying them will get us good code. Consistently the promise of reuse and maintainable code was broken.

With acquired power and features, we started solving bigger issues. Later time, we started enhancing the solutions. It took less time for us to understand that, code has become increasingly complex. So complex, that upgrade is becoming very hard. There were times when we need to rewrite the entire code, re architect it.

Simple, Good and maintainable code still an impossible target to achieve.....

## What are the basic principle to write a maintainable code?

There were extensive study and analysis done on techniques to achieve this. On gradual study we arrived at OOP principles which will helped us to simplify things. Basic OOP design principles to follow while designing the solution are as explained below.

* Encapsulate what varies.
* Favor Composition over Inheritance.
* Program to Interface, not to implementation.
* Depend on Abstraction, do not depend on concrete class.
* Strive for loosely coupled design between object that interact.

# Encapsulate what varies
# Favor Composition over Inheritance

A Java user group meeting where James Gosling was the featured speaker. During the memorable Q&A session, someone asked him: “If you could do Java over again, what would you change?” 

he answered :
“I’d leave out classes,” he replied. 

What made him think of removing Class itself from the programming language?

James Gosling, explained that the real problem wasn’t classes per se, but rather implementation of inheritance (the extends relationship). Interface inheritance (the implements relationship) is preferable. You should avoid implementation of inheritance whenever possible.

# Program to interface, not implementation
# Depend on Abstraction, do nt dpend on concrete class
# Strive for loosely coupled design between OBJECT that interact
