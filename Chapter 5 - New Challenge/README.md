# New Challenge

Road to Object Oriented Programming was open and many of us came up with new languages to code in Object Oriented way.

we started getting traffic jam. Consistently the promise of  reuse and maintainable code was broken. Half of the us started believing, knowing an object oriented principle and applying them will get them good code.

Adding on to the existing situation there were more enhancement done to the Object Oriented


## What was the new challenge?

With acquired power and features, we started solving bigger issues. Later time, we started enhancing the solutions. It took less time for us to understand that, code has become increasingly complex. So complex, that upgrade is becoming very hard. There were times when we need to rewrite the entire code, re architect it.

Simple, Good and maintainable code still an impossible target to achieve.....

## What are the basic principle to write a maintainable code?

There were extensive study and analysis done on techniques to achieve this. On gradual study we arrived at OOP principles which will helped us to simplify things. Basic OOP design principles to follow while designing the solution are as explained below.

* Encapsulate what varies.
* Favor Composition over Inheritance.
* Program to Interface, not to implementation.
* Depend on Abstraction, do not depend on concrete class.
* Strive for loosely coupled design between object that interact.

## How to gauge the quality of Class?
Grady Booch proposes five metrics to measure the quality of classes:

      Coupling
      Cohesion
      Sufficiency
      Completeness
      Primitiveness
