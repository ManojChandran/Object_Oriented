# Design Pattern

Now the stage is set and we are ready for big leap. We have quality Objects and Perfect guidelines to implement it. We started building maintainable code with next generation programming language, but re-usability is still a concern and every time we end up re-inventing the wheel.

With Object Oriented design principle in hand, their implementation is big thing. Proper implementation will provide us with maintainable and re-usable code.

Known principles are :

* Encapsulate what varies.
* Favor Composition over Inheritance.
* Program to Interface, not to implementation.
* Depend on Abstraction, do not depend on concrete class.
* Strive for loosely coupled design between object that interact.


# How to implement Object Oriented design principles?

In the 1994 a mile stone book came in software engineering, it was called Design Pattern and it was work of four authors, later known as Gang of Four.

```
Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994) is a software engineering book
describing software design patterns. The book was written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson,
and John Vlissides, with a foreword by Grady Booch. The book is divided into two parts, with the first
two chapters exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, and the remaining
chapters describing 23 classic software design patterns.

23 Patterns where identified and categorized, these were general Repeatable/ Proven solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

## Creational
Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

## Structural
Structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.

## Behavioral
Behavioral patterns are concerned with the assignment of responsibilities between objects, or, encapsulating behavior in an object and delegating requests to it

Once you get hold on these Design Patterns, you are ready to solve mysteries and go beyond. Ultimately, solution is also an Object which has a meaning now .....
