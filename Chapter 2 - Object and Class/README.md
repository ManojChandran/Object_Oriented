# Object and Class

Every idea has its significance, when the solutions it can offer is high. Once the idea "Object" was born, everybody worked towards to apply it. First and foremost thing to do, is to define the idea.  

## What are Objects and Classes?
An Object in real world will have attributes (color, texture,..) and behavior(scroll, bend..). In computer world, Object is a package of both data(attribute) and procedures (behavior) that operate on that data. When we define the object, we will end up creating a "CLASS".

```java
// Simple dog class.
public class Dog {
   String breed;  // attribute
   int age;
   String color;

   void bark() {    // behavior
	    System.out.println("Bow Bow");
   }

   void happy() {
	    System.out.println("Spins Tail");
   }
}
```

Class is a blue print of the object, attributes are the data and methods were its behavior. The efficiency and design of the class will, improves our solution. Success of our software solution, depends on

* How "Object" is defined with a "Class"?
* How interactions between "Object" happens?
