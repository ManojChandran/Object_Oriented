# Object and Class

An Object in real world will have attributes (color, texture,..) and behavior(scroll, bend..). When you define the same in computer world, A "CLASS" is born.

Object (attribute & behavior)
--> Define object's attribute and behavior, we will get a Class.

Class is a blue print of the object, its efficiency and design improves your solution. All success of your solution, depends on
   1) How you define object with a class?
   2) How you define interaction between objects, using classes?
