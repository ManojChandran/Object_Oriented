# Object and Class

Every idea has its significance, when the solutions it can offer is high. Once the idea "Object" was born, everybody worked towards to apply it. First and foremost thing is to define the idea.  

An Object in real world will have attributes (color, texture,..) and behavior(scroll, bend..). In computer world, Object is a package of both data(attribute) and procedures (behavior) that operate on that data. When we define the object, we will end up creating a "CLASS".

```java
// Simple dog class.
public class Dog {
   String breed;
   int age;
   String color;

   void bark() {
	    System.out.println("Bow Bow");
   }

   void happy() {
	    System.out.println("Spins Tail");
   }
}
```

Class is a blue print of the object, attributes are the data and methods were its behavior. The efficiency and design of the class will, improves your solution. All success of software solution, depends on

>   1) How "Object" is defined with a "Class"?
>   2) How interactions between "Object" happens?
