# Introduction

Every idea has its significance, when the solutions it can offer is high. Once the idea "Object" was born, everybody worked towards to apply it. First and foremost thing is to define it.  

# Object and Class

An Object in real world will have attributes (color, texture,..) and behavior(scroll, bend..). When you define the same in computer world, will end up creating a "CLASS".

Class is a blue print of the object, attributes are the data and methods were its behavior. The efficiency and design of the class will, improves your solution. All success of software solution, depends on

   1) How object is defined with a class?
   2) How interactions between objects happens?

# Object oriented programming

```
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.
