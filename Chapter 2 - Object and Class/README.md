Every idea has its significance, when the solutions it can offer is high. Once the idea "Object" was born, everybody worked towards to apply it. First and foremost thing is to define it.  

# Object and Class

An Object in real world will have attributes (color, texture,..) and behavior(scroll, bend..). When you define the same in computer world, will end up creating a "CLASS".

Class is a blue print of the object, attributes are the data and methods were its behavior. The efficiency and design of the class will, improves your solution. All success of software solution, depends on

   1) How object is defined with a class?
