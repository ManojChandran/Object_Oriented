# Class properties and capabilities

Guidelines help us to create an efficient CLASS, whats next?

# What happens when an efficient class is created?

An efficient Class construction will give you the object, which have all real world object properties. This Object orientation gives the object, features like

1) Encapsulation - reduce complexity and increase reusability
2) Abstraction  - reduce complexity and isolate impact of changes
3) Inheritance - eliminate redundant code
4) Polymorphism - Refactor ugly switch case statements

# What happens when Object acquires real world properties?

This Enhances the created object in their interaction and operations. The Objects inside solution will acquire capabilities mentioned below

1) Association
2) Aggregation
3) Composition
4) Dependency
