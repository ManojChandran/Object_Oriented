# Class properties and capabilities

Guidelines help us to create an efficient CLASS, whats next?... An efficient CLASS, without interaction is of no use. By defining class and instantiating it, we create Object.

# What happens when an efficient class is created?

An efficient CLASS construction will give you the object, which have all real world object properties.
Also provide us with 4 major principles which make the solution designed an Object Oriented one.

4 major principles are :
1) Inheritance
2) Polymorphism
3) Abstraction
4) Encapsulation

# Expanding Principles

1) Inheritance</br>
Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. It will eliminate redundant code

2) Polymorphism  
Polymorphism describes a pattern in object oriented programming in which classes have different functionality while sharing a common interface. It refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms. Refactor ugly switch case statements

3) Abstraction   
Abstraction is about hiding unwanted details while giving out most essential details. It reduce complexity and isolate impact of changes.

4) Encapsulation  
Encapsulation is an idea of bundling data and methods that work on the data within one unit. It is a mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods. It reduce complexity and increase re-usability.

# What happens when Object acquires real world properties?

This Enhances the created object in their interaction and operations. The Objects inside solution will acquire capabilities mentioned below

1) Association
2) Aggregation
3) Composition
4) Dependency
